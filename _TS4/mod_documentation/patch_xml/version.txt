PatchXML v1.2.1 for The Sims 4 v1.108.329 and S4CL v3.5
Created on 2024-07-25
v1.2.1
    Improved identification of bogus tunings.
    During 1st start and/or after a game update all tuning IDs are logged.
    The time stamps can be matched with Vanilla Logs.
    Vanilla Logs are needed as exceptions within TS4 are caught internally and Patch-XML doesn't receive them.
