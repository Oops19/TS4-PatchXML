TODO:
    Save tunings to patched/ and load them from there
v1.0.13
    Tested with TS4 v1.107
v1.0.12
    Improved logging
    Fixed a bug
v1.0.11
    Return XML without the 'n', 's' ad 'i' attributes 1:1, don't throw an exception
v1.0.10
    Basic support for http://xpather.com/ XPath syntax.
    Avoid to add spaces to the XPath expression around `@=,[]()"'` etc. as such strings can't be converted.
        Exception: 1-n spaces behind ',' are supported.
    '', '/I', -> '.'
    '/I/X/Y/Z' -> 'X/Y/Z'
    '/X[text()="Y"]' with '/[X="Y"]/X'
    '/X[contains(text(), "Y"]' with '/[X="Y"]/X'  # not correct, no longer a contains check!
    '/*' will be removed as it is not supported!
    
    A simple expression can be used 1:1, e.g.:
    * '/I/X[text()="Y"]/../Z' will be translated to '[X="Y"]/X/../Z'
    
    For '/[T="text"]' matches: 
        Remove all comments from xml before parsing. 'Y' does not match 'Y<-- Whatever -->'
v1.0.9
    Improved logging
v1.0.8
    Require XmlPatcher(add_comments=True) to add comments to generated files.
v1.0.7
    Modified log imports to use this mod without TS4.
    Allow to add a comment also while modifying XML.
    It is not recommended to add comments with config files during startup as this may cause issues for TS4.

v1.0.2
    Updated README for new TS4 version
v1.0.1
    Removed comments from patch files which TS4 can't handle properly
v1.0.0
    Update docs
v0.0.16
    Fix tag.strip() exception
v0.0.15
    Updated documentation and compile script

    Change logging to CommonLog
v0.0.7
    Minor code cleanup
v0.0.6
    Allow empty i/instance and tuning_ids to be specified. For the rare cases when it is necessary.
v0.0.5
    Add cheat commands:
    'o19.tunings.patch file.txt n': Config file (in patch_xml/cfg/) and tuning_id to test. The modification can't be applied while testing.
        If the patch looks fine restart the game to apply it. Or use Live XML to patch it.
    'o19.tunings.pretty False': Disable formatting the XML.
    'o19.tunings.comments False': Disable comments in XML.
    'o19.tunings.write n': Write tuning for tuning_id n.
    'o19.tunings.write 0': Write all tuning files. This takes 5..30 minutes depending on the used DLCs.
    
    Optimize startup and caching. The start times are usually below one second.
    The first startup time after installing or a game update will be 1..2 minutes to initialize the cache.
v0.0.4
    Read and combine configuration files
    Add some configuration files.
v0.0.3
    Create tuning.xml from memory
    Initialize VanillaTunings and use get_tuning() to retrieve individual tuning files. 
v0.0.2
    Read tuning.xml from disk
    Patch f(hard-coded configuration)
v0.0.1
    Initial version
    Extract and save tuning.xml files
